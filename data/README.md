# The data folder

This folder should contain data that is used by the analysis. However, data that is large should not be hosted on github.
Make sure to keep large files in your `.gitignore`-file.
Other options that are reproducible are availble. We suggest using the osf.io website, because the `osfr` package allows seemless data downloads.
